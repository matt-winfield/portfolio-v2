This project was developed as part of my third year dissertation for University. It is a three tier web application which supports chess games played online between two people, single player games against the computer offline, and offline multiplayer functionality. It is implemented as a PWA which allows for functionality without internet connection (including playing against the computer).

This project allowed me to expand and apply my knowledge with technologies such as SignalR, cloud computing and development of PWAs. This project also provided an opportunity to practice and develop my existing skills with ASP.NET web api development, database design and front-end web development.
