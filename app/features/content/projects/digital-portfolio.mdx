This is my digital portfolio. I've rewritten this portfolio several times using various different frameworks, languages and technologies:

-   First in Next.js
-   Then in Remix using [the Epic Stack](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack), hosted in the cloud using Fly.io
-   Then simplified to a regular Remix app using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and MDX, hosted on a VPS using Dokku

I use this portfolio to experiment with and learn about new things.
