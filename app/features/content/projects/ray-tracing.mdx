This project was an experiment with 2d ray tracing to produce a 3d environment.The user can move and rotate the camera through a "3D" environment generated from a 2D map of walls.

The project is developed in React.Rays are cast from a camera in 2D, and then the distance of the ray to the nearest wall is used to calculate the displayed height and brightness.This is a technique similar to that used early 3D games such as "Wolfenstein 3D".
