During the COVID-19 lockdown, me and my friends would meet up on video calls and play various online games together. We organised a virtual quiz, and needed some way of working out who answered first. This was the inspiration behind creating this buzzer system, which would allow people to "buzz in" as soon as they knew the answer to the question.

I only had a few days to implement the system, so some shortcuts were taken. One example of this is that all storage on the API is done in-memory (instead of using a database) as this was significantly faster to implement, at the cost of scalability. This decision was worth it though, as this system was only intended to be used by a handful of users at a time.

The core requirements for this system were for it to be simple to invite players to a room, intuitive to use, record and display the order that players buzzed in as well as the time difference between them, and the creator of the room can add and remove points from players depending on if they got the answer correct.

An extra feature that would be useful to add that was found from using the system during a lockdown quiz is to introduce a customisable time limit after the user presses the buzzer in which they must answer, to prevent buzzing before the player knows the answer.
